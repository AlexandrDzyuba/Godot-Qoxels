# Qoxel – Voxel System Prototype for Godot 4.x

This project is **not a full implementation** of a voxel system. Instead, it presents a **concept and partial implementation** to illustrate a potential approach to building a voxel-based system in Godot 4.x. It is provided **as a prototype** and will require additional development, optimization, and polishing to be production-ready.
